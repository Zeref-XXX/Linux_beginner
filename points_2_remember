Linux have 3 standard streams

1> stdin  [ standard input  ] code is 0

2> stdout [ standard output ] code is 1

3> stderr [ standard error  ] code is 2

To redirect the output to other files 

use > 

example :
 ls > op.txt  
[ this won't show any output instead it will make a file and having output of the command. > overwrite any text if present in the files]

ls >>op.txt
[this will do the same as above but will not overwrite the content , it only adds or appends in the file]

 Error 

typing any command wrongly will gives error i.e. 

tg 

Now to avoid this/ ignore the error we use code 2 

lg 2> we.txt

this will redirect it 

-------------------------------------------

environment variable
 
store usefull information that system/shell/user needs, its value keeps on changing as we user our system or make some changes.

env - commands shows the environment present in the system


example-  
echo $home -  $home is a variable and prints the home directory of current user
 
echo $user - prints the name of current user

$path - stores the path of the present commands/ just like path variable in windows
